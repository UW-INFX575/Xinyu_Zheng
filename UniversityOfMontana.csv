 Betsy,Bach,University of Montana,Communication Studies,"I received my Ph.D. in Speech Communication from the University of Washington in 1985 and specialize in organizational communication, where my two major research areas are the mentoring and socialization of organizational newcomers. I enjoy listening to the experiences of organizational newcomers as they try to negotiate life in organizations, and find their experiences of change, contrast, and surprise very exciting. I use these stories to coach organizational ""veterans"" how to make the socialization experiences of newcomers less stressful (for both newcomers AND veterans). More recently, I am reading in and turning my research interests to communication in ""chosen kin"" relationships. 

My passion is teaching, which I enjoy tremendously. I was honored to receive the University of Montana's Distinguished Teacher Award in 1991 and the Master Teacher Award from the Western States Communication Association in 1992.

I also enjoy management responsibilities and was very grateful to be nominated by the COMM department for (and be awarded) Montana's Academic Administrator Award in 1996, I have also served as President of the Western States Communication Association, the Northwest Communication Association, and as Director of the Educational Policies Board for the National Communication Association. In 2009 I was elected as President of the National Communication Association, and was very honored to serve in this capacity."

His research focuses on the causes and consequences of victimization, a topic that he has explored from many different perspectives. He has examined how lifestyles influence victimization risk and how victimization, in turn, affects lifestyles. He has also explored the emotional impact of crime, examining how victimization influences fear of crime. Recently, he has studied the relationship between criminal activity and victimization risk, focusing on how offending and victimization influence one another over time. Currently, he is researching the ways in which the experience of different forms of criminal victimization affects future victimization risk. Recent reports of his research appear in Criminal Justice and Behavior, Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice, and Crime and Delinquency."
 James,Burchfield,University of Montana,Systems Ecology,"I have been fortunate to have experience as both a rural sociologist and a forester, as my major interest centers on how people may reside and interact with forest and grassland settings in a productive, harmonious manner. I am curious about the manner in which science-based tools can improve the effectiveness of community groups in the development of plans and activities on forested lands. I received my academic training at the University of Washington and the University of Michigan, and my PhD dissertation explored the success of voluntary associations among small private woodland owners. Recent work has examined the effects of wildfires on rural communities and the implications of stewardship contracting on public lands. Prior to becoming the Associate Dean, I was the Director of the Bolle Center for People and Forests at the University of Montana. For nearly 20 years I worked for the USDA Forest Service in Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington, with a three year assignment in Washington D.C. as a policy analyst in the International Program Office. I also spent three years in the mid-1970's as a Peace Corps Volunteer in a small rural village in northern Guatemala. It was there that I came to learn beekeeping, as well as the dignity, humor, and resiliency of the human spirit in the face of hardship."

My undergraduate degrees are a BS in Biology (Ecology) and a BA in Philosophy from Seattle Pacific University. After graduating from SPU I worked for a year and a half with the Food and Drug Administration as an Investigator. That job was a great learning experience and I was able to get an inside look at politics, regulation, and the industrial food system. My education and work background contribute to my current research interests in Deep Ecology, Philosophy of Technology (as it applies socially, culturally, and environmentally), accounts of knowledge and objectivity that address the Naturalistic fallacy, animal welfare in agricultural settings, and many more! There are many paths from this education that I am currently considering, including: PhD work in Philosophy, teaching in general, political activism, writing, and again, many more. Two of the things that I like most about this program are the openness to interdisciplinary work (philosophy, political science, natural sciences, social sciences, etc.) and the emphasis on applying theory to current and ongoing environmental issues. And last but not least, studying in Missoula has allowed me to embrace the outdoors, which inspires much of the work in this field, while doing the work itself. "

 Robert,Saldin,University of Montana,Political Science,"I am an Associate Professor of Political Science, the Director of the Project on American Democracy and Citizenship, and a Fellow in Ethics and Public Affairs at the Mansfield Center. I write and teach about American government, political development, and public policy. My first book was War, the American State, and Politics since 1898 (Cambridge University Press, 2011; paperback, 2013), and my scholarly articles have appeared in outlets such as The Journal of Politics, the Journal of Policy History, and Political Research Quarterly. From 2010-2012, I was on leave at Harvard University as a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar in Health Policy Research.

 James,Scott,University of Montana,Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures,"Having grown up in the Chicago area and later in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan near the shores of Lake Superior, I traveled west to the mountains in search of more cold and snow, which I didn't find. Nevertheless, I have made my family and career in this lovely state. After 10 years of high school teaching, I finished my PhD in Classics, and, Deo gratias, found an adjunct professorship at The University of Montana. Twenty-six years later and a tenured professor,  I am  retired. My wife and I have in Bigfork (MT) a small hobby farm, populated by horses, sheep, donkeys, walk-on cats, and our dogs. Life and work have been a wonderful blessing here in Missoula. I am teaching autumn, 2010, on a post-retirement contract."

 Vicki,Watson,University of Montana,Environmental StudiesSystems Ecology,"Born on a small family farm in the vanishing Texas blackland prairie, I grew up watching my parents struggle to protect the small creek that ran through the back of our farm from the growing town & industry upstream. That's a battle we still fight to this day, 50 years later. I completed a BS in biology (U. Houston) and a PhD in aquatic ecology (U. Wisconsin). After a brief time as the staff scientist for Citizens for a Better Environment, I was hired as an environmental scientist by the University of Montana in 1983 and have served on that faculty ever since. My research, teaching and service focus on the conservation, preservation and restoration of watersheds.  My grants have included studies of cyanide and heavy metals leaching from abandoned cyanide leach mines and the fate and effects of herbicides applied for roadside weed control. I worked with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to develop a statewide water quality monitoring system and have collaborated with DEQ in characterizing Montanas streams & lakes for the past 12 years. I was also part of a team that helped EPA develop nutrient criteria guidance documents for the US.  "
